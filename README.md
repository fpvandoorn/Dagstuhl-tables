# Dagstuhl's Happy Diner Problem

## The Table Assignment Assignment

What is the minimum number of meals so that each of the `n` conference participants can share at least one meal with every other participant when eating at tables of at most `t` persons? We call this number `T(n,k)`

In particular, we have an unlimited number of tables, and we do not require that any two participants have a meal together exactly once, or that every table is fully occupied.

Legend: we use lowercase `a`-`e` to justify lower bounds and upper case `A`-`E` to justify upper bounds, which are explained below. 
No explanation is given when `n <= k` or `k = 2` or the value can be derived from the inequalities `T(n+1,k) >= T(n,k) >= T(n,k+1)`.

## Properties

### Known values

* `T(n,2) = n` if `n` is odd, `T(n,2)=n-1` if `n` is even 
  * The lower bound is given by `c`, see below. 
  * The upper bound can be obtained as follows.
    * Suppose `n = 4m`: split it up in 2 groups of size 2m, first do those groups independently in 2m-1 days, then in the next 2m days on day i let person j in group 1 sit with person i+j (mod 2m) in group 2.
    * Suppose `n = 2m` with m odd:
      the first m days on day i let person i sit with i+m and person i+j with i-j.
      the next 2k:=m-1 days, on day 2k-1 and 2k let person i sit with person i+2k-1 and i-(2k-1). If i is even it will sit with i+2k-1 first, and if i is odd it will sit with i-(2k-1) first.
    * Suppose `n` is odd, then we can use the solution for `n+1` participants, dropping 1 participant

* `T(n,k) = 1` if `n <= k`
* If `k < n <= (3/2)k` then `T(n,k) = 3` (`dD`)
  * It cannot be done in 2 days, because on day 1 there are at least 2 tables. All participants on table 1 need to be sit with all participants not on table 1 on day 2, but that means that everyone needs to sit together on day 2. Contradiction. (`d`)
  * It can be done in 3 days. Suppose `2k-n >= Ceil(k/2)`, i.e. `2k-n >= k/2`, i.e. `3k >= 2n`.
    Then 3 sets of size `k` can cover all pairs: 
    On day 1 sit participants `1--k` together.
    On day 2 sit `(k+1)--n` and participants `1--Ceil(k/2)` together.
    On day 3 sit `Ceil(k/2)+1 -- n` together.

### Relations:
* `T(n+1,k) >= T(n,k) >= T(n,k+1)`. If a value in the table can be derived from these inequalities, they are no other explanation is given.


### Lower bounds:
* `T(n,k) >= (n-1)/(k-1)` (special case of `a`(?))
* `T(6m+1,3) >= 3m+1` (special case of `c`)
* `a`: Suppose `n = m*k+l` with `0 <= l < k`.
  There are n(n-1)/2 pairs. 
  At most m*k*(k-1)/2+l*(l-1)/2 pairs can be formed per meal.
  So T(n,k) is at least equal to the quotient of these 2.
  This bound is at least as good as `T(n,k) >= (n-1)/(k-1)` (?)
  This bound is indicated by
* `c`: If `n = m*k+1` then this bound is `n(n-1)/(m*k*(k-1)) = n/(k-1)`. 
  Suppose `k - 1 | n` (i.e. `n == -(k-1) mod k(k-1)`). Then
  `T(n,k) >= n/(k-1)+1`, because if it's possible after `n/(k-1)` days, we need to form `m*k*(k-1)/2` new connections every meal. This means that
  (1) every table needs to be size `k`, except for 1 table of size 1 every meal.
  (2) Nobody can meet the same person twice
  This means that after every meal, the number of participants participant A has met is divisible by `k-1`, so it can never equal `n-1`.
* `e`: proven by hand
* `f`: this follows from the solution of the social golfer's problem, found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050308115423/http://www.icparc.ic.ac.uk/~wh/golf/).

### Upper bounds:
* `A`: `T(km,k) <= T(m,k) + m` if `m` is coprime with `(k-1)!`
* `B`: `T(nl,kl) <= T(n,k)`. This can be seen by making `n` groups of `l` people each and always seating all people in a single group together
* `C`: `T(nl+1,kl+1) <= T(n,k)`. Same as `B`, but make one group size `l+1`.
* `E`: found solution by hand
* if `n <= 3^{m+1}` then `T(n,3) <= n/2 + (5/2)m` (so `T(n,3)` is only logarithmically above the easiest lower bound `(n-1)/(k-1)`.
* `T(n,k) <= n/(k-1) + O(1) * log(n)/log(k)` (I think)
* Conjecture: for all `k`, `T(n,k) - n/(k-1)` is bounded by a constant
